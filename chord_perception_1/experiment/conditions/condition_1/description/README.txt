Sound complexity

In this condition, the complexity of the sound spectrum, i.e. the number of harmonic of is varied.

The two levels that the variable takes on reflect the extreme ends of the sound complexity continuum:
1) pure tones (single frequency or harmonic per tone) 
2) piano tones (many frequencies or harmonics per tone).
