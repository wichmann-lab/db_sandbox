Absolute tone position

In this condition, the absolute position of tones within the chord varied. Chords were composed of 5 different tones, with the tones increasing in frequency from the lowest (tone #1) to the highest (tone #5). In every trial in which the probe tone was contained in the chord (i.e. trials where 'yes' would be the correct response or 'correct trials'), the probe tone could take one of 5 positions in the chord. The probe index in correct trials ranged from 1 to 5.

This variable was only relevant for trials where the probe tone was present in the chord to see if the absolute position of a tone in a chord affects the ability to perceive it.
