Each participant completed a questionnaire before beginning the experiment which asked about the subjects' musical training, self-rated musical ability and the perceived difficulty of certain musical tasks.

Based on their musical experience, the subjects were divided into three groups:
1) Naive - NF
2) Amateur - JK, AL, DT, JS
3) Professional - DC, CS
