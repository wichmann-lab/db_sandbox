The experimental script file (chordPerception.m) contains code for generating and presenting the stimuli. To run the code, one needs the functions in the files createNoise.m, createProbe.m and toneName.m, variables in the files mainStimuli.mat, practiceStimuli.mat, weightings.mat, mainTrialOrder.mat and practiceTrialOrder.mat, and the .wav files in the â€˜stimuli/generation/materials' folder.
