Stimuli

This experiment used auditory stimuli to investigate how different factors affect the ability to detect individual tones that are played simultaneously, in the form of chords. The experiment followed a yes-no task design, thus the stimuli comprised of chords and probe tones. A Gaussian white noise mask was used between trials to minimise the influence of successive trials on each other. The tones to construct the stimuli were either pure tones or artificial piano tones. The generation of the stimuli is described in the ‘generation’ folder. 

The compositional structure of chords

The chords used in both experiments consisted of five frequency components. Every chord spanned a range of between 2-3 octaves and the interval between neighbouring tones was always below an octave.
Half of the presented chords were consonant, composed of the notes of a major triad. The other half of the chords were dissonant, composed of tritone, major seventh and major second intervals. The figure ‘experiment/stimuli/description/chord_shapes_and_probes.pdf’ shows the chord shapes used, with C3 as an example starting pitch, as well the probes associated with each chord shape. Additionally, four other starting pitches were used (G#2, A#2, D3 and E3). Chords Cons. 1 - Cons. 5 were functional inversions of each other. Chords Diss. 1 - Diss. 5 were functional inversions of each other. To contain the full range of frequencies required by all inversions to the middle five octaves of a piano, inversions were transposed to begin less than a perfect fifth above or below the starting pitch of the root inversion. This transposition does not affect the relative relations, nor the absolute positions, of chord components.

As 10 different chord shapes were used (5 consonant, 5 dissonant), with 5 starting pitches each, a total of 50 different chord stimuli were used. However, the same chord shape with different starting pitches were treated as functional repetitions.

Probe tones

The probes in both experiments consisted of single tones. 11 different probe tones were associated with each chord shape, 5 of which were correct probes (i.e. identical to the components that were used to construct the chord) and 6 of which were incorrect, or foil probes (i.e. tones which were not present in the chord). All probes were contained within the range of the chord such that no probes were higher or lower than the highest or lowest tone in the corresponding chord, respectively.

Half of the six foil probes for consonant chords were consonant (shown in figure ‘experiment/stimuli/description/chord_shapes_and_probes.pdf’ in blue) and the remaining half were dissonant (shown in figure chord_shapes_and_probes.pdf in red). The foil consonant probes consisted of tones which were part of the same major triad that was used to construct the chord but which were not present in the chord. Each consonant chord was constructed to contain 3 consonant ‘slots’ of unused consonant tones, and these tones formed the set of foil consonant probes. The intervals between the consonant probes and their neighbouring chord components comprised consonant intervals - perfect fourths, a major thirds and a minor thirds. The foil dissonant probes were offset from the frequencies of the consonant probes so as to maximise dissonance with the chord. The dissonant probe formed either a tritone, minor second or a major second with at least one of its two nearest chord components.

All foil probes for dissonant chords were similarly considered to be dissonant as the dissonant context established by the chord itself could not be resolved with any single tone. The foil probes always formed either a tritone, minor second, major second or a minor third with at least one of its two nearest chord components.
