The experimental hardware setup consisted of a computer, headphone amplifier and headphones. Digital signal generation, output and response collection were implemented in MATLAB (2013b and 2016b) with the Psychtoolbox-3 extension (Kleiner et al., 2007), running on either a Linux-powered desktop computer (Ubuntu 14.04) or laptop (Linux Mint 17.1). Subjects JS,DT and HH completed the experiment using a desktop computer, subjects YB, SC, FE using a laptop computer.
The stimuli were presented through the Grace Design m903 reference headphone amplifier / DAC and Ultrasone Signature Pro headphones.
