The experimental script file (chordPerception.m) contains code for initialising the Grace m903 amplifier as the audio device with the Psychtoolbox extension, for using it for audio playback and for closing the device. To run the code, one needs the functions in the files createNoise.m, createProbe.m and toneName.m, variables in the files mainStimuli.mat, practiceStimuli.mat, weightings.mat, mainTrialOrder.mat and practiceTrialOrder.mat, and the .wav files in the â€˜stimuli/generation/materials' folder.
