Relative tone position

In this condition, the relative position of tones within consonant chords varied. Consonant chords were composed of the three elements of the major triad (the tonic, the third and the fifth), however, the absolute position of the chords didn't follow this order (the tonic as the lowest, the third in the middle and the fifth as the highest tone). Therefore, the relative and absolute positions of tones were independent of each other. The different relative positions play different functional roles in the chord, therefore this variable explored whether the functional position of a tone in a chord affects the ability to perceive it. 

The possible relative positions:
1) Tonic (tone coincides with the key of the major triad and the lowest note of the triad in its root position, the octave in which it appears is irrelevant)
2) Third (tone coincides with the third note in the key of the major triad and the middle note of the triad in its root position, the octave in which it appears is irrelevant)
3) Fifth (tone coincides wiht the fifth note in the key of the major triad and the highest note of the triad in its root position, the octave in which it appears is irrelevant)

This variable was only relevant for consonant chord trials where the probe was consonant with the chord (i.e. trials where the probe tone was present in the chord, or foil (incorrect) probes which used components of the same major triad that were but had not been present in the chord).
