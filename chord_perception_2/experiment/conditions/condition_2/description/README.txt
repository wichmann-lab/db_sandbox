Chord consonance

In this condition, the consonance of the chord was varied. 

The two levels that this variable takes on reflect the extremes of the consonance continuum:
1) Consonant (chords composed of consonant intervals (notes of the major triad))
2) Dissonant (chords composed of highly dissonant intervals)
