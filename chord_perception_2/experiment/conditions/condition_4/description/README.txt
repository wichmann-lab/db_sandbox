Probe consonance

In this condition, the consonance of the foil probe tone in relation to the chord was varied. The probe tones in these trials were not present in the chord but either matched the major-triad-based chord or not. 

The relationship between the chord and probe:
1) Consonant. The probe tone was a note from the set of notes in the major triad that was used to construct the 5-component chord but which remained unused in the chord and formed consonant intervals with the closest tones in the chord.
2) Dissonant. The probes were chosen to maximise dissonance with the chord, so that the probe tones formed strongly dissonant intervals with at least one of its two closes tones in the chord.

This variable was only relevant for consonant chord trials with foil (incorrect) probes. In the trials with dissonant chords, the dissonant context could not have been resolved with any single tone, rendering all possible probe tones dissonant and making the comparison of probe consonance impossible.
