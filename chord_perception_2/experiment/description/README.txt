Perception of individual tones in 5-tone chords

Psychoacoustic experiment investigating how the ability to detect individual components of 5-tone chords (simultaneously played tones) depends on the complexity of the tones (piano vs pure tones), the consonance of the chord (consonant vs dissonant), the consonance of the probe tone (consonant vs dissonant), the absolute and relative position of the tone within the chord.
