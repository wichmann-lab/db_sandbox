The stimuli to be detected, the signals, were horizontally orientated sinusoidal gratings. The signals were presented against uniform fields of the same mean luminance as the signal (10.20 cd/m^2).

Each observer did at least 2 mixed and 10 uncertainty sessions as described below. This results in 100 trials per contrast in the mixed condition and 50 trials per contrast in the uncertainty condition.

We did 2 kinds of sessions: alone and uncertainty sessions. In alone sessions we presented 50 trials per contrast of one frequency in random order. These sessions thus contained (12x50=) 600 trials each.
In the uncertainty sessions we mixed the spatial frequencies presenting each contrast of the 3 cyc/deg grating 90 times and each of the 12 and 0.75 cyc/deg grating contrasts 5 times. This resultsin(90+5+5)x12=1200 trials per uncertainty session.

Each session was divided in blocks of 50 trials after which the subject could take a short break if he/she wanted and contained a forced break of 5 minutes every 300 trials.

The signal gratings were gated on and off inside a tapered cosine temporal envelope of 250 ms duration. The rising falling cosine each lasted 4 frames (= 66.6 ms). The signal had the a circularly symmetric spatial Hanning window with a radius of 2.22125 deg of visual angle at the viewers eyes.

The two 250 ms observation intervals of each trial were separated by a 250-ms ISI. A signal grating of a given contrast was presented in one of the two observation intervals, and the observers were required to indicate which interval had contained the signal by pressing buttons on a ResponsePixx response box during the 800 ms answer interval that followed the second observation interval. The signal appeared in the first interval of each trial with probability 0.5. Tones marked the beginning and end of each observation interval, and, after the 800 ms response interval, tones indicated which interval had contained the signal. The timing of a trial is illustrated in figure trial_timing (The X-Axis is time in ms with 0 at the beginning of the first stimulus interval. The top row shows the change in stimulus-contrast. The second row shows the tones, which indicated the time intervals. The last row shows the response interval. ITI= inter trial interval, STIM 1 = first stimulus interval, ISI = inter stimulus interval, Response = response time. Dashed vertical lines indicate the borders between intervals.)

The phase of the grating with respect to the spatial window changed randomly from observation interval to observation interval; one of twelve phases (uniformly distributed over 2π rad) was chosen for each presentation.

Stimuli were presented at a frame rate of 72 Hz (with no interleaving), and the linearity of the system was assessed with a photometer (Gamma Scientific S470 Optometer) to ensure that any distortion introduced by the display was negligible.
All experimental stimuli were presented as a 512 by 512 pixel array; the central portion of the display was used. The remaining pixels surrounding the central square were set to the mean luminance. The display was viewed binocularly with natural pupils at a distance of 165 cm so that the central square subtended 4.4425 by 4.4425 deg of visual angle at the observer’s eyes and each pixel subtended approx- imately 0.52 arc min of visual angle. During the whole experiment little 50 pixel long cross-hairs were presented in the corners of the area the stimuli were presented in, to allow a better accomodation and to restrict the area to attend. The arrangement of the stimulus is illustrated in figure stimulus_arrangement (The whole gray rectangle symbolizes the 1600x1200 px. screen. The part masked by the physical mask is symbolized by the black bars (9.4 mm high), the lighter gray bars symbolize parts outside the screen visible from the observers position (5.9 mm wide). The crosshairs in the corners of the grating stimulus were presented all time. The grating only according to the experimental structure. (px = pixel, mm = millimeter, ◦ = degrees of visual angle at 1650 mm distance, the viewing distance).
