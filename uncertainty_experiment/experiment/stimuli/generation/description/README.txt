The stimuli were generated in MATLAB as floatingpoint arrays, which were transformed into 16 bit resolution integer textures by Psychtoolbox (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner, Brainard, & Pelli, 2007). This toolbox was also used to present the stimuli on a suitably linearized Eizo SMM21106LS 6GF6300-1EU01 (CRT) display at 1600x1200 pixel resolution. The computer used for stimulus presentation had a AMD HD7970 graphics card.The Connection to the screen was made through a datapixx connector, which also controlled a 5 button response box. This connection allowed us to present our stimuli at 16 bit luminance resolution.
