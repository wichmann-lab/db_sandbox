In this condition, the uncertainty associated with the spatial frequency of the stimulus is varied. The possible spatial frequency values that the stimulus can take in each trial are 0.75, 3 and 12 cyc/deg. 

In some sessions, all trials have the same spatial frequency (either 0.75, 3 or 12). 

In some blocks, 90% of the trials contain stimuli with the spatial frequency of 3 cyc/deg, interspersed with stimuli with the spatial frequency of 0.75 cyc/deg (5%) and 12 cyc/deg (5%).
