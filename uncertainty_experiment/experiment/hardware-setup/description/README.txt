We presented the stimuli on a suitably linearized Eizo SMM21106LS 6GF6300-1EU01 (CRT) display at 1600x1200 pixel resolution. The computer used for stimulus presentation had a AMD HD7970 graphics card.The Connection to the screen was made through a datapixx connector, which also controlled a 5 button response box. This connection allowed us to present our stimuli at 16 bit luminance resolution.
